**What is DupeBull?**
DupeBull is a plugin for anarchy servers to reintroduce dupe glitches in the latest version of paperspigot.
It is **no longer maintained** and **no support will be given**, use at your own risk!
It has no configuration file and is extremely barebones, if you want to improve it feel free to clone or fork the project.

**Usage (for players)**
Get on a chested horse with items inside the chest and on half a heart. Get right next to a nether portal and run /dupebull or /db. If fulfilled, the chested horse will be killed and its inventory will be dropped twice.
